# envkey-python

Integrate [EnvKey](https://www.envkey.com) with your Python projects to keep API keys, credentials, and other configuration securely and automatically in sync for developers and servers.

Compatible with Python 2 and 3.

# v2

Now that [EnvKey v2](https://v2.envkey.com) has been released, you can find version 2 of this package in [a subdirectory of the EnvKey v2 monorepo](https://github.com/envkey/envkey/tree/main/public/sdks/languages-and-frameworks/python). Using v2 requires an EnvKey v2 organization (it won't work with ENVKEYs generated in a v1 org).

[Here's a guide on migrating from v1 to v2.](https://docs-v2.envkey.com/docs/migrating-from-v1)

To continue using version 1 of this package, make sure you specify `==1.*` when installing with pip so that you don't accidentally install v2.

## Installation

```bash
$ pip install envkey==1.*
```

Then at the entry point of your application:

```python
import envkey
```

For **Django**, you should put the above in `manage.py` and `wsgi.py`. Also see the [note on casting below](#django-environ-casting) if you're migrating from `django-environ`.

## Usage

Generate an `ENVKEY` in the [EnvKey App](https://github.com/envkey/envkey-app). Then set `ENVKEY=...`, either in a gitignored `.env` file in the root of your project (in development) or in an environment variable (on servers).

Now all your EnvKey variables will be available in `os.environ`.

Or as a bit of syntactic sugar to avoid needing to always import `os` alongside `envkey`, you can call `envkey.get`, which delegates to `os.environ.get`. For example:

```python
import envkey

my_var = envkey.get("SOME_ENVKEY_VAR")

```

### Errors

The package will throw an error if an `ENVKEY` is missing or invalid.

### Example

Assume you have `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` set for the `development` environment in the EnvKey App. You generate a local development `ENVKEY`.

In your project's **gitignored** `.env` file:

```bash
# .env
ENVKEY=GsL8zC74DWchdpvssa9z-nk7humd7hJmAqNoA
```

In `app.py`:

```python
stripe.api_key = os.environ['STRIPE_SECRET_KEY']
```

Or using the `envkey.get` sugar:

```python
stripe.api_key = envkey.get('STRIPE_SECRET_KEY')
```

Now `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` will stay automatically in sync for all the developers on your team.

For a server, generate a server `ENVKEY` in the EnvKey App, then set the `ENVKEY` as an environment variable instead of putting it in a `.env` file.

Now your servers will stay in sync as well. If you need to rotate your `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` you can do it in a few seconds in the EnvKey App, restart your servers, and you're good to go. All your team's developers and all your servers will have the new value.

### Overriding Vars

This package will not overwrite existing environment variables or additional variables set in a `.env` file. This can be convenient for customizing environments that otherwise share the same configuration. You can also use [sub-environments](https://blog.envkey.com/development-staging-production-and-beyond-85f26f65edd6) in the EnvKey App for this purpose.

### Working Offline

This package caches your encrypted config in development so that you can still use it while offline. Your config will still be available (though possibly not up-to-date) the next time you lose your internet connection. If you do have a connection available, envkey will always load the latest config. Your cached encrypted config is stored in `$HOME/.envkey/cache`

For caching purposes, it's assumed you're in development mode when a `.env` file exists in the root of your project.

### Disabling autoload

If you'd like to have more control over how your config is loaded, you can prevent the package from auto-loading on import by setting `ENVKEY_DISABLE_AUTOLOAD=1` either in your `.env` file or as an environment variable.

You can then load your config explicitly like this:

```python
import envkey

envkey.load(cache_enabled=True, dot_env_enabled=True, dot_env_path=".env")
```

For even more flexibility, you can just fetch your config as a dict (without setting it on `os.environ`) like this:

```python
import envkey
import os

config = envkey.fetch_env(os.environ['ENVKEY'], cache_enabled=True)
```

### django-environ casting

If you happen to be migrating from `django-environ` to EnvKey, watch out for the fact that EnvKey *does not* cast variables to booleans or any other non-string types as `django-environ` does. All variables set by EnvKey will be *strings* in accordance with the cross-platform environment variable standard. See: https://twitter.com/manishsinhaha/status/1265746057377361921

## envkey-fetch binaries

If you look in the `ext` directory of this package, you'll find a number of `envkey-fetch` binaries for various platforms and architectures. These are output by the [envkey-fetch Go library](https://github.com/envkey/envkey-fetch). It contains EnvKey's core cross-platform fetching, decryption, verification, web of trust, redundancy, and caching logic. It is completely open source.

## x509 error / ca-certificates

On a stripped down OS like Alpine Linux, you may get an `x509: certificate signed by unknown authority` error when this package attempts to load your config. [envkey-fetch](https://github.com/envkey/envkey-fetch) tries to handle this by including its own set of trusted CAs via [gocertifi](https://github.com/certifi/gocertifi), but if you're getting this error anyway, you can fix it by ensuring that the `ca-certificates` dependency is installed. On Alpine you'll want to run:
```
apk add --no-cache ca-certificates
```
